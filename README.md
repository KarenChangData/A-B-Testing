# Project of AB Testing

## Objectives:
### The goal of this project is to apply different statistics methods to decide if a company should implement a new webpage to increase the number of users.

# Contents:
### Part I - Probability: 
We calculated the percentage of conversion rate for both old and new webpage and determine if it's needed to launch new page.

### Part II - A/B Testing: 
Here we defined null hypothesis which assumes the old page performs better than the new page. We applied bootstrapped and sampling distribution to determine if the result (p-value) is significant to reject null hypothesis.


### Part III - A Regression Approach:
We applied logistic regression which allows us to consider additional factors, such as group and countries. Based on the result of logistic regression, we made comparision with AB testing result.
